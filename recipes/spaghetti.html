        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This spaghetti recipe will blow your <em>socks</em> off! Victoria and I were for the most part free stylin' when we came up with it, so we know that you won't have trouble experimenting with it!

            The taste of the dish is rich & delicious and the notes of buttery basil in the pasta will have you begging for more. We cleaned our plates and felt <strong>no</strong> remorse grabbing seconds.
